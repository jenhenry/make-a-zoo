This is my second project using React. This app has the following features:

1. Created with create-react-app
2. Uses localStorage to "save" new or updated zoos
4. Includes functional, class based, and pure components
5. Uses React Router for app navigation
6. Uses Bootstrap 4
7. Utilizes new features in ES6

STILL TO DO
* Improve responsiveness
